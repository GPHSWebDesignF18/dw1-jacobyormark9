    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Digital media designers are usually trained in certain things such as: motion graphics, screenwriting, video editing, digital audio production and video production. Courses for digital media designers most likely consist of web design, digital imaging, screenwriting and media production. Digital media often appears in a digital magazine or even more recently, ae-book. Now rather than being designed as a replica of a print material, the product is created from complete scratch and then is accessed on a digital platform. </p>
   <p class="text_column">	Media design also involves physical, functional, and operational "manifestation" of what is called the human-factors design. Media design is the physical and solid front end of the human-technology system. Digital media designers can also create their products in a digital or even electronic format as opposed to the graphic designers, who apply something called graphic imaging to not only digital but even tangible platforms.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, and modified on digital electronics devices. While there are some graphic design lessons that can be taught to a digital media designer, alot of these professionals are more into animation or motion graphics. </p>
